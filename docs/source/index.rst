Insolar Documentation
=====================

.. note::

   Insolar's documentation is under development, its structure is not yet finalized. Expect updates soon.

To get a grip on how Insolar works, take a look at its :ref:`architecture overview <architecture>`.

To connect to TestNet 1.1, go through :ref:`step-by-step instructions <connecting_to_testnet>`.

To learn how to form and send signed requests to Insolar's API, go through :ref:`tutorial <building_requester>`.
