Distinctive Features
====================

The Insolar platform is built to satisfy enterprise requirements by combining distributed and cloud technologies and dozens of industry-first features. Insolar is currently designing the proposed platform in an incremental fashion allowing it to progressively grow into the ultimate decentralized collaborative environment for various kinds of industries, companies, governments, and communities.
Insolar sees these many features and capabilities as a mandatory part of blockchain implementation and integrates them as part of the Insolar platform.


Federation of Clouds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Transparently connects multiple clouds based on Insolar technology, where each cloud runs and is governed independently (e.g., by a community, company, industry consortia, or national agency).

Cloud
~~~~~
Organizes and unifies software capabilities, hardware capacities, and the financial and legal liability of nodes to ensure the transparent and seamless operation of business services (more details provided in Section 4.14).

Globular Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The backbone of a cloud. It is a set of protocols enabling the coordination of P2P networks of up to 1,000 nodes and a hierarchical network of up to 100,000 nodes (more details provided in Section 4.9).

.. _omniscaling:

OmniScaling
~~~~~~~~~~~
Is an integral feature that utilizes a multi role model of nodes, a multichain organization of storage, and an innovative approach to distributing work across the network by combining a network-wide membership consensus with deterministic role allocation, and with individual validation groups per each transaction. As a result, OmniScaling enables near-linear and dynamic scalability by CPU, storage capacity, and traffic (network throughput) for domains running within a cloud.

Domain
~~~~~~
Enables different governance models, it defines policies for data and contracts, such as to allow public or permissioned models, or to apply national or industry standards (more details provided in Section 4.13).

Data Safety
~~~~~~~~~~~
Cost-efficient data safety and leakage prevention for shared cloud solutions through data scattering and density limits, atomic re-encryption, permissioned node access, signatures from nodes that have accessed data, and so on.

Capacity Marketplace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A special domain within a cloud that defines procedures for business services to do spot and long-term trading for CPU, storage, and traffic as commodities (more details provided in Section 9.3).

Separation of Business Logic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Helps to focus on what is essential for a business to operate and allows for the deployment of new business services as easy as creating a new mailbox or a website.

Business Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Come from a separation of business logic with the use of domains, making the reuse of business logic possible either as components or as full application templates for easy deployment (more details provided in Section 9.1.3).

Per-transaction Consensus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Allows validation and finality requirements to be defined as business logic components on a per-transaction basis to match the value and risk of transaction versus the speed and cost of validation.

Data and Execution Scattering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Together with atomic proxy re-encryption algorithms, data and execution scattering significantly reduce the impact of intrusions and data leakage for off-premise settings.

Support for Large and Long Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Makes it easy to exchange documents, build complex business services, and use dynamic binding of services via marketplaces. It significantly reduces the complexity of development and deployment for the storage and processing of off-chain documents, while simultaneously increasing the consistency and integrity of blockchain solutions.

Integration and Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Provided via contracts and virtual machines, which can be attached to specific nodes and operate as integration gateways.

Native Support of Industry-standard Languages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Native support of contracts based on industry-standard languages, such as Golang and JVM, as well as support for distributed transactions and microservice-like integrations of contracts to enable the use of existing practices and skills.
