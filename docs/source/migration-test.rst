Testing Token Migration
=======================

This test scenario walks you though the process of acquiring test INS tokens and swapping them for test XNS coins.

During the testing period of the Insolar MainNet, all operations will be performed with test XNS coins (native for MainNet).

.. _needs_for_migration_test:

What You Will Need
------------------

You need to create two wallets:

* **Ethereum wallet** that supports Ethereum test networks (Ropsten in particular) and custom tokens. This test scenario uses `MetaMask <https://metamask.io/>`_ as an example.
* **Insolar Wallet** in which you can store XNS coins that are native for the MainNet.

Additionally, you need to understand the following:

* **What coins and tokens are**. Coin is a native cryptocurrency of any blockchain and token is a unit of value that may be built on top of it. Coins operate independently, while tokens have specific uses. In the Ethereum network, the coin is the ether (ETH) and the token standard (upon which the INS token is built) is called ERC-20. Test tokens and coins are those that operate in test networks. For testing purposes, we are going to use the Ropsten test network.
* **What a crypto faucet is.** The faucet is a quick and easy way of creating and distributing test coins and tokens in test networks.
* **What a token contract is.** Essentially, a token contract is a smart contract that contains a map of account addresses and their balances. The unit of the balance is the token. When tokens are transferred from one account to another, the token contract updates the balances of the two accounts.

.. _test_overview:

Test Scenario Overview
----------------------

To grasp what you will be doing, take a look at the steps of the test scenario:

#. Create a MetaMask wallet and, inside, switch to Ropsten test network and add the INS custom token.
#. Get Ropsten test ETH coins.
#. Swap the coins to test INS tokens using the INS token contract.
#. Create an Insolar Wallet and, automatically, receive a migration address.
#. Send the test INS tokens from the MetaMask wallet to the migration address. They will automatically swap to XNS native coins and appear in the Insolar Wallet.

All the above steps are described in detail in subsequent sections.

Creating and Setting Up Ethereum Wallet
---------------------------------------

To create and set up a MetaMask Ethereum wallet:

#. Go to `metamask.io <https://metamask.io>`_ and add its extension to your browser.
#. Open the extension, click :guilabel:`Get Started`, :guilabel:`Create a Wallet`, and agree or disagree to help MetaMask improve itself.
#. Create a new password, confirm it, and agree to the "Terms of Use".
#. Reveal the backup phrase, copy it, and click :guilabel:`Next`.
#. Click the words of the backup phrase in correct order and then click :guilabel:`Confirm`.
#. Receive congratulations from MetaMask and click :guilabel:`All Done`. You will see the wallet's user interface.
#. In the top right corner, select :guilabel:`Ropsten Test Network` from the drop-down list:

#. In the bottom left corner, click :guilabel:`Add Token`:

   .. image:: imgs/add-token.png
      :width: 700px

   |

#. On the **Add Tokens** screen, open the :guilabel:`Custom Token` tab:

   .. image:: imgs/custom-token.png
      :width: 300px

   |

#. Copy the INS token contract address -- click the copy icon |copy-icon| in the right corner of the following code block:

   .. |copy-icon| image:: imgs/copy-icon.png
      :width: 20px

   .. code-block::

      0x7e94f2be613c6846c40325b0f2712269a0d61d10

#. In the :guilabel:`Token Contract Address` field, paste the copied INS token contract address:

   .. image:: imgs/ins-token.png
      :width: 300px

   MetaMask will find the INS token symbol and decimals of precision for you. Click :guilabel:`Next`.

#. On the next screen, click :guilabel:`Add Tokens`:

   .. image:: imgs/add-ins.png
      :width: 300px

   With that, the MetaMask wallet is set up to operate the test ETH coins and INS tokens:

.. _acquire_test_tokens_and_swap:

Acquiring Test ETH Coins and Swapping Them to Test INS Tokens
-------------------------------------------------------------

To acquire, first, test ETH, then swap them to test INS tokens:

#. In the MetaMask wallet, first, click the :guilabel:`ETH` tab, then :guilabel:`Deposit`.

   .. image:: imgs/eth-deposit.png
      :width: 700px

   |

#. In the **Deposit Ether** window, click :guilabel:`Get Ether` next to **Test Faucet**:

   .. image:: imgs/get-eth-from-faucet.png
      :width: 700px

   This opens the `MetaMask Ether Faucet page <https://faucet.metamask.io/>`_.

#. On the opened page, click :guilabel:`request 1 ether from faucet`:

   .. image:: imgs/request-one-eth.png
      :width: 400px

   MetaMask will ask you to connect the request in the newly opened window. Click :guilabel:`Connect`:

   .. image:: imgs/connect-request.png
      :width: 300px

   Once connected, you can click :guilabel:`request 1 ether from faucet` several times more. The corresponding transaction entries will appear below:

   .. image:: imgs/test-eth-txes.png
      :width: 450px

   Wait several seconds to let the transactions be processed by the test network and return to the MetaMask wallet.

#. In the MetaMask wallet's **History**, the confirmed transactions will appear and your balance will be updated. Click :guilabel:`Send`:

   .. image:: imgs/meta-balance.png
      :width: 700px

   |

#. Again, copy the INS token contract address -- click the copy icon |copy-icon| in the right corner of the following code block:

   .. code-block::

      0x7e94f2be613c6846c40325b0f2712269a0d61d10

#. On the **Add Recipient** screen, paste the copied address to the search field:

   .. image:: imgs/send-search-field.png
      :width: 300px

   The MetaMask wallet will recognize the INS token contract and display the transfer details:

   .. image:: imgs/meta-transfer-details.png
      :width: 300px

#. On the **Send Tokens** screen, first, click :guilabel:`Max` to send all test ETHers, then :guilabel:`Advanced Options` to set the gas value:

   .. image:: imgs/advanced-options.png
      :width: 300px

   |

#. On the **Customize Gas** screen, set the :guilabel:`Gas Limit` to ``80000`` (eighty thousand) and click :guilabel:`Save`:

   .. image:: imgs/gas-limit.png
      :width: 300px

   .. caution:: If the gas limit value is lower than 80,000, the token contract will fail.

#. Back on the **Send ETH** screen, click :guilabel:`Next`:

   .. image:: imgs/finally-send-eth.png
      :width: 300px

   And, on the next screen, click :guilabel:`Confirm`:

   .. image:: imgs/finally-confirm.png
      :width: 300px

   Repeat the procedure of sending ETH to INS token contract several more times to acquire enough test INS tokens.

   Once the corresponding transactions are confirmed, the MetaMask wallet is set up to operate test INS tokens:

   .. image:: imgs/meta-wallet-setup.png
      :width: 700px

   Next, migrate test INS token to the Insolar network. The migration will automatically swap the test INS tokens to test XNS coins.

.. _migrate_test_tokens:

Migrating Test INS Tokens and Swapping Them to XNS Coins
----------------------------------------------------------

To migrate the test INS tokens and swap them to XNS coins:

#. Create your Insolar Wallet.

   .. note:: Upon the MainNet release and the start of the testing period, an appropriate link we be pasted here.

   Upon creation, the Wallet takes care of security for you:

   #. Generates a backup phrase and private key using randomization. They are synonymous in function.
   #. Encrypts the key with your password and puts it in a keystore file. You can use this file to access your wallet and authorize operations.
   #. Ensures that you make a record of the backup phrase. Using this phrase, you can restore the Wallet in case you lose the private key or the keystore file and your password.

#. On the Insolar Wallet main page, click :guilabel:`CREATE A NEW WALLET`.
#. Enter a new password, confirm it, agree to the "Term of Use", and click :guilabel:`NEXT`.
#. Reveal the backup phrase, copy it, and click :guilabel:`Next`.
#. Enter the requested words in the correct order and click :guilabel:`OPEN MY WALLET`.
#. Wait for the Wallet validation to complete and all features to become available.

   Once the Wallet is created, it will require you to save the keystore file either:

   * In your browserâ€™s local storage.
   * By downloading it to your computer.

   Keeping the file locally allows easier access from the browser on the device you are using.
   To access your wallet from another device, download the file and move it, for example, via a USB drive.

#. Click :guilabel:`DOWNLOAD` to save the keystore file or click :guilabel:`SAVE LOCALLY` to save the file to your browser's local storage.

   Later, you can log in using one of the following:

   * Your password and the keystore file.
   * Unencrypted private key.

   Either way, the Wallet does not store the private key. Instead, it uses the private key provided every time to authorize login and operations. While logged in, you can copy your unencrypted private key, but keep in mind, this is its most vulnerable form.

#. In the Insolar Wallet, click the avatar icon |avatar-icon| in the upper right corner to open the menu.

   .. |avatar-icon| image:: imgs/avatar-icon.png
      :width: 30px

#. In the **Your Wallet** menu, click :guilabel:`Copy migration address` and return to the MetaMask wallet.
#. In the MetaMask wallet, open the :guilabel:`INS` tab and click :guilabel:`Send`:

   .. image:: imgs/meta-send-ins.png
      :width: 700px

#. On the **Add Recipient** screen, paste the copied migration address to the search field:

   .. image:: imgs/send-search-field.png
      :width: 300px

   |

#. On the **Send Tokens** screen, first, click :guilabel:`Max`, then :guilabel:`Next`:

   .. image:: imgs/send-ins-to-mig-addr.png
      :width: 300px

   And :guilabel:`Confirm` the transaction:

   .. image:: imgs/confirm-send-to-mig-addr.png
      :width: 300px

   Once the transaction is processed by the Ropsten test network, your XNS test coins will appear in the Insolar Wallet.

   This concludes the migration test.
